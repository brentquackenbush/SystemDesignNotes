# Detailed OTT System Design Considerations

## Scalability
### Typical Patterns for Handling Millions of Concurrent Users
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to avoid overloading any single server.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to the system to handle increased load.
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in fast-access storage to reduce load on databases.

### Handling Peak Traffic
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjusting the number of active servers based on current traffic demands.
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing system overload by controlling the rate of user requests.
- **Queuing**: Temporarily holding requests in a queue when the system is at peak capacity.

## Availability and Reliability
### Importance in Video Streaming Services
- **User Experience**: Ensuring a consistent and uninterrupted viewing experience.
- **Brand Reputation**: Maintaining reliability is crucial for user trust and service credibility.
- **Revenue Impact**: High availability directly correlates with user retention and revenue generation.

## Performance: Minimal Buffering and Low Latency
### Technologies and Strategies
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Distributes content closer to users, reducing latency.
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Dynamically adjusts video quality based on user's internet speed.
- **Edge Computing**: Processes data closer to the end user, reducing latency.
- **Optimized Content Delivery Protocols**: Such as HTTP/2 and QUIC for faster data transfer.

## Non-Functional Requirements and CAP Theorem

## Prioritization in OTT Systems
- **Availability Over Consistency**: Ensuring the system remains accessible over having perfectly synchronized data across all nodes.
- **Partition Tolerance**: The ability to function despite partial network failures or partitions.

## Strategies for Balancing CAP Theorem Constraints
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accepting some latency in data synchronization across different nodes.
- **Redundant Systems**: Having backup systems to take over in case of a failure.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributing traffic across multiple nodes to ensure even load distribution and availability.
- **CDN Usage**: Leveraging CDNs to handle heavy traffic and improve global content delivery.
